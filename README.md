# RIPTC

`Pwn`, `difficulty:Hard`

Lyrics: RIPTC  
Composer: Krias aka Digging into kernel  

I'm fond of the days that are retro  
Hate the future's unpredictable echo  
Peep into the kernel, take a look  
Revive the code that the attack took  
Found one new 0 day, what a magic  
Triggering the moment, I've lost the knack  
Patching up the class, secrets I pack  

*Source code added a few files, ain't no pretense*  
*Three characters added in another file, spotted only in vmlinux, no defense*  

Friends from afar, they arrive  
Could you help me thrive, like eating greens, time
